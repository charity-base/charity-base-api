## Running
Once you've built the charity-base database - as described in [charity-base/data] (https://github.com/tithebarn/charity-base/tree/master/data) - running the API is easy. Assuming you're in the charity-base directory:
```bash
$ cd api
$ node server.js
```
Now visit `http://localhost:3000` - you should see it running.

## Endpoint
The API has one endpoint - `GET /api/v0.2.0/charities/` - which returns charity documents from the database. Options are specified in the URL query string and there is no user authentication.

The API responds to successful requests with status code `200` and a JSON body of the form
```javascript
{
  "version": "v0.2.0",
  "totalMatches": null,
  "query": {
    ...
  },
  "charities": [{
    ...
  }]
}
```

Failed requests will receive status code `400` and a body of the form
```javascript
{
  "message": "Your request failed because..."
}
```


## Counting Results
By default the value of `totalMatches` in the response is `null` because counting the total number matches for some queries is slow.  However you can explicitly request the value by including `countResults` in the query string:
```bash
GET /api/v0.2.0/charities/?countResults
```

## Pagination
By default the number of charities returned from each request is limited to `10`.  This can be changed with the `limit` query parameter whose value is capped at `50`.

If the value of `totalMatches` in the response is greater than 10 (when `countResults` included in query) you can page through the results by specifying `skip` in the query string (`skip` can take any value but use multiples of `limit` to get sequential pages).

For example, to return the third page of results with 30 charities per request:
```bash
GET /api/v0.2.0/charities/?limit=30&skip=60
```

## Filter Parameters
The fields `charityNumber`, `subNumber`, `registered` and `mainCharity.income` (defined in the schema `charity-base/models/charity.js`) can be specified in the query string to filter results.  The package `api-query-params` is used to translate these query string parameters to a database query, supporting a wide range of [filter options] (https://github.com/loris/api-query-params#supported-features).

For example:
* Request registered, main (non-subsidiary) charities with no reported income:

    ```bash
    GET /api/v0.2.0/charities/?registered=true&subNumber=0&!mainCharity.income
    ```

* Request & count de-registered, subsidiary charities of The Royal Society (the answer is 94)

    ```bash
    GET /api/v0.2.0/charities?countResults&registered=false&charityNumber=207043&subNumber>0
    ```

* Request registered, main charities with non-zero gross income less than (or equal) Â£17k

    ```bash
    GET /api/v0.2.0/charities?registered=true&subNumber=0&mainCharity.income>0&mainCharity.income<=17000
    ```

In addition to filtering by the fields above, there is another filter parameter `search` which performs a text search over all working names of each charity (accepts `=` operator only).  For example, to find registered charities with "London" and "NHS" in one of their working names:
```bash
GET /api/v0.2.0/charities/?registered=true&search=nhs+london
```

## Projection Parameters
Returned charity objects always have the following properties: `charityNumber`, `subNumber`, `name` and `registered`.  All other fields defined in the schema `charity-base/models/charity.js` can be requested using the query parameter `fields`, which expects a comma-separated list of fields.

For example, to return the gross income, registration history and number of volunteers of each registered, main charity:
```bash
GET /api/v0.2.0/charities/?registered=true&subNumber=0&fields=mainCharity.income,registration,beta.people.volunteers
```

Note: if the `search` filter parameter is used, the `score` of the text-matching will also be returned with each charity.

## Sorting Parameters
Unless the `search` parameter is used, results are by default returned in order of ascending `charityNumber` and then `subNumber`.  If `search` is used they are returned in order of descending `score` (i.e. most relevant first).

This behaviour can be overridden using the query parameter `sort`, which expects a comma-separated list of fields.  It is recommended to only sort by fields which have an index defined in `charity-base/models/charity.js`.  Fields in the list may be prefixed with `-` to sort in descending order.  For example, to find charities in descending order of gross income (and to project the income):
```bash
GET /api/v0.2.0/charities/?sort=-mainCharity.income&fields=mainCharity.income
```
